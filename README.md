Section C: Federation and Assertion
    https://www.nist.gov/video/special-publication-800-63-3-public-draft-webinar 

Using the NIST 800-63 Sections A/B/C, develop an Identity Policy that will be 
used to create a login profile for your new users as well as a password/
authentication device reset.
Some situational context:
For simplicity, your users are US based only, Hybrid work environment, they are 
NOT allowed to work remotely from OCONUS (Outside the Continental US).

You can find templates online for similar policies, therefore, you have the freedom in the format chosen, as long as it is well/clearly developed.  

What to submit:
    1 - Upload the document to your Github profile.  
    2- Create a 10-15 minutes video explaining your policy and how it relates to the NIST 800-63 publication, then add the URL to your Github profile under the 
    same project repo/Directory.
    3- Submit the URL to your Github profile (the page should show the Policy as well as the URL to your youtube demo).
